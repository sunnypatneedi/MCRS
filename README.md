# Medication Consensus Resolution Squad (MCRS) Data Specification

## Overview

This repository contains the open-source data specification for the Medication Consensus Resolution Squad (MCRS). The MCRS spec defines a standardized way to represent Medication Change Requests (MCRs) and their associated resolution workflows, particularly in multi-caregiver scenarios.

## Purpose

*   **Standardize Data:** Provide a common format for MCRs and resolution processes.
*   **Improve Interoperability:** Facilitate seamless data exchange between healthcare systems (EHRs, SMART on FHIR apps).
*   **Enhance Safety:** Address conflicting medication instructions via a structured consensus workflow.
*   **Support Compliance & Analytics:** Define schemas for audit logs and notifications.
*   **Align with FHIR:** Integrate with HL7 FHIR standards where applicable.

## Key Components

*   **Documentation (`/docs`):** Human-readable specification details, workflows, and FHIR mappings.
*   **Schemas (`/schemas`):** Machine-readable definitions (JSON Schema, Protobuf).
*   **Examples (`/examples`):** Sample MCR payloads in JSON and YAML.

## Getting Started

Refer to the documentation in the `/docs` directory for detailed information on the specification, data models, and workflows.
